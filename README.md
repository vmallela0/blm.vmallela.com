This website was a project I did after talking to some friends who were talking about not being able to find BLM protests near them. I would look at twitter pages where they posted protest locations so that I could confidently provide accurate data regarding protests throughout Georgia. Although the project is no longer active because of other work that I had to do, it still shows all of the protests that have happened in June of 2020.
