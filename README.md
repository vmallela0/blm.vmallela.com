This is a personal website. The landing page is a UNIX layout command line and is capable of handling some UNIX-themed commands. The rest of the website is pretty straightforward and I tried to be minimalistic in the design of it. The blog is under a seperate Github repository and a seperate subdomain. 
## Hosting 
Although it was a slight annoyance getting this site up and running right, with help from my friends @AditSachde and @Vinzhu07 I got it up using Netlify. 
## What's the point
I wanted this website to showcase some projects I've been working on and to show some of the challenges/choices I make in my process as well as to market myself. Currently I work on a lot of side projects and I find this is the best way to learn computer science.
